      <h1>In plain English?</h1>
      <p>We're providing this service for free because we believe in simplifying microservices. While we're
      exceptionally good at what we do, nobody is perfect. This service has limited security
      precautions, so it's a "use at your own risk" situation. That said, we feel comfortable enough to use it
      in production for our own systems. Here are the measures we have taken to make this service great:</p>
      <li>All API calls (over-the-wire) use 2048 or 4096-bit SSL encryption from a trusted root authority (i.e. recognized by your operating system).</li>
      <li>The API supports user-provided encryption keys. They're not required, but are strongly recommended.</li>
      <li>If an encryption key is provided, data at rest is stored as a hash using your key.</li>
      <li>We do not store encryption keys on our servers. That means we can't see your data. It also means we can't recover it for you if you lose your key.</li>
      <li>We use AES-256-CBC encryption. This is stronger than MD5, but still reversible so you can read your data. Again: keep your key safe.</li>
      <br/>
      <p>Now that the legal stuff is out of the way, we hope you find the service useful.
      If the terms are unsatisfactory, please reach out to us. We have a consulting business
      in which we can help customize a version of this service and the legal terms around it.</p>
