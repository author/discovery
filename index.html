      <h1>Microservice Discovery</h1>
      <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
      <p>Microservices architecture requires the components within the environment to communicate
      with each other. This implies each service knows how to contact the others. This seemingly
      simple task becomes more challenging when the makeup of the environment changes, such
      as adding/removing/updating services.</p>
      <p><strong>dicovery.author.io</strong> acts as a catalog of microservices. Each microservice
      can obtain an updated list of other services within it's network. Using the <a href="./api">REST API</a>, managing
      networks and nodes (services) is a trivial task.</p>
      <p>For example, a microservice environment may consist of three separate services running
      indepedently, possibly even on servers around the world. The discovery service provides a single
      place to retrieve microservice data.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Microservice environments are often dynamic. The catalog can change regularly.
      To support this, the discovery service has a <a href="./webhooks.html">webhook event system</a>.
      Using this system, it is possible for microservice environments to react to changes in the network
      as they happen.</a>

      <h1>Getting Started</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>First, there are special instructions for gaining access to the API. You can activate these
        instructions by reading and agreeing to the <a href="./legal.html">terms of service and privacy policy</a>
        (sorry, we have to require this).</li>
        <li>Create a network. <a href="./api/#operation--network-post">(see how to create a network)</a></li>
        <li>Start adding nodes (services). <a href="./api/#operation--node-post">(see how to add a node)</a></li>
        <li>Check out the <a href="./webhooks.html">webhooks documentation</a> to react to changes in your new network catalog.</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Why was this Created?</h1>
      <p>We've been working on a microservices platform called <a href="http://github.com/ngnjs" target="_blank">NGN</a> on and off
      over the last few years. With new tools like <a href="http://docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a>,
      <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, and <a href="https://golang.org" target="_blank">Go</a>, the
      case for microservice infrastructure has become clearer. At Author.io, we are obsessed with making great developer
      experiences. We felt this discovery service was a simple way to enhance the experience of microservice creation.
      </p>
      <p>More specifically, we're using this service with NGN. NGN has a container called the "NGN Bridge". It
      acts like a traffic cop, directing traffic between microservices. The discovery service allows multiple
      NGN Bridges to communicate with each other, even if they're not on the same local area network. As a result,
      NGN can communicate with just about any microservice, whether it's on a LAN/WAN/Cloud/etc.</p>
